# Cat clicker app
The cat-clicker is a website built for practice purposes. The exercise teaches how expectations may constantly change for an app
and the importance of using MVO techniques to organize javascript in large projects, in order to make the code more understandable and maintainable. 

## How to use
The app initially includes 5 buttons that refer to 5 different cats and an "admin" button. By clicking one of the 5 buttons a card will open
showing the relevant cat, it's name and a number. The number refers to the number of times you have tapped the cat's image and gets updated every time
you do it. You can also select another cat from the list.

The **admin button**, opens a form which allows the user to **replace the selected cat** with his own cat, by adding the cat's name, image URL link and number of taps
and submitting those information.

### Issues and warnings

As mentioned before, this app was built as an exercise with the purpose of learning MVO techniques, so there might be accessibility,
performance, compatibility and other issues, since there was not given emphasis on those aspects of the website.
